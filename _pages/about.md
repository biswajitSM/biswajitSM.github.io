Hey there! I'm Biswajit, and I'm fascinated by the tiny details that make life tick. I'm currently on a quest to unravel the mysteries of DNA organization at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics. My background is a bit of a mix - I've built microscopes, delved into the world of single molecules, and even written code to make sense of all the scientific data. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of science and technology, and I'm always up for collaborating on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out - let's chat about science, life, or anything that sparks your curiosity!
